## Business Objectives

Having a dynamic website as well as an integrated online/mobile precense is vital in today's connected economy. A clear and professional webiste using RWD will help greatly in marketing. A robust online/app experience will communicate professionalism, creating an information hub, reducing phone calls and other questions about the business. 

## Background

One of the biggest constraints in this business is the time it takes to drive and meet with clients. Not to mention the time/lost time in planning appointments, missed appointmnets, and rescheduling as well as special trips for things like signing paperwork and minor emergencies.

## Scope

The scope of this project will be on creating a dynamic company web application using the principles of RWD.

## Delivery schedule
